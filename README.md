<h1>Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet</h2>
:earth_americas:https://plqualls.github.io/Leaflet-challenge/
<body>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We have been hired as a scientists for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) which is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land use change. The responsibility of the scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.</p>
    
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A new project which consists of building a new set of tools that will allow the visualization of earthquake data.  A massive amount of data has been collected and the ultimate goal is to be able
to visualize the data efficiently and better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.</p>
    
<h2>:clipboard:Tasks To Complete</h2>
<h3>Level 1: Basic Visualization(Required)</h3>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Get Data Set: Visit page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.</li>
<li>Import & Visualize the Data: Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set.</li>
<li>Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the 
earthquake by color. Earquakes with high magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes
with greater depth should appear darker in color.</li>
<li>Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.<li>
<li>Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.</li>
</ol>
